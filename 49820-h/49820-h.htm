<p><i id="quote">Nothing in the history of mankind has opened our eyes to
the possibilities of science as has the development of atomic
power. In the last 200 years, people have seen the coming of
the steam engine, the steamboat, the railroad locomotive,
the automobile, the airplane, radio, motion pictures, television,
the machine age in general. Yet none of it seemed quite
so fantastic, quite so unbelievable, as what man has done
since 1939 with the atom ... there seem to be almost no
limits to what may lie ahead: inexhaustible energy, new
worlds, ever-widening knowledge of the physical universe.</i>

<h2 id="c16">MASS AND ENERGY</h2>
<p>In 1900 it began to dawn on physicists that there was a
vast store of energy within the atom; a store no one earlier
had imagined existed. The sheer size of the energy store in
the atom&mdash;millions of times that known to exist in the form
of chemical energy&mdash;seemed unbelievable at first. Yet that
size quickly came to make sense as a result of a line of
research that seemed, at the beginning, to have nothing to do
with energy.</p>
<p>Suppose a ball were thrown forward at a velocity of 20
kilometers per hour by a man on top of a flatcar that is
moving forward at 20 kilometers an hour. To someone
watching from the roadside the ball would appear to be
travelling at 40 kilometers an hour. The velocity of the
thrower is added to the velocity of the ball.</p>
<p>If the ball were thrown forward at 20 kilometers an hour
by a man on top of a flatcar that is moving backward at 20
kilometers an hour, then the ball (to someone watching from
the roadside) would seem to be not moving at all after it left
the hand of the thrower. It would just drop to the ground.</p>
<p>There seemed no reason in the 19th century to suppose
that light didn&rsquo;t behave in the same fashion. It was known to
travel at the enormous speed of just a trifle under 300,000
kilometers per second, while earth moved in its orbit about
the sun at a speed of about 30 kilometers per second. Surely
if a beam of light beginning at some earth-bound source
shone in the direction of earth&rsquo;s travel, it ought to move at a
speed of 300,030 kilometers per second. If it shone in the
opposite direction, against earth&rsquo;s motion, it ought to move
at a speed of 299,970 kilometers per second.</p>
<p>Could such a small difference in an enormous speed be detected?</p>

<p class="caption small"><i>Albert A. Michelson</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>The German-American physicist Albert Abraham
Michelson (1852-1931) had invented a delicate instrument,
the interferometer, that could compare the velocities of
different beams of light with great precision. In 1887 he and
a co-worker, the American chemist Edward Williams Morley
(1838-1923), tried to measure the comparative speeds of
light, using beams headed in different directions. Some of
this work was performed at the U. S. Naval Academy and
some at the Case Institute.</p>
<p>The results of the Michelson-Morley experiment were
unexpected. It showed no difference in the measured speed
of light. No matter what the direction of the beam&mdash;whether
it went in the direction of the earth&rsquo;s movement, or against
it, or at any angle to it&mdash;the speed of light always appeared
to be exactly the same.</p>
<p>To explain this, the German-Swiss-American scientist
Albert Einstein (1879-1955) advanced his &ldquo;special theory of
relativity&rdquo; in 1905. According to Einstein&rsquo;s view, speeds
could not merely be added. A ball thrown forward at 20
kilometers an hour by a man moving at 20 kilometers an
hour in the same direction would not seem to be going 40
kilometers an hour to an observer at the roadside. It would
seem to be going very slightly less than 40 kilometers an
hour; so slightly less that the difference couldn&rsquo;t be measured.</p>
<p>However, as speeds grew higher and higher, the discrepancy
in the addition grew greater and greater (according to a
formula Einstein derived) until, at velocities of tens of
thousands of kilometers per hour, that discrepancy could be
easily measured. At the speed of light, which Einstein showed
was a limiting velocity that an observer would never reach,
the discrepancy became so great that the speed of the light
source, however great, added or subtracted zero to or from
the speed of light.</p>
<p>Accompanying this were all sorts of other effects. It
could be shown by Einstein&rsquo;s reasoning that no object
possessing mass could move faster than the speed of light.
What&rsquo;s more, as an object moved faster and faster, its length
in the direction of motion (as measured by a stationary
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
observer) grew shorter and shorter, while its mass grew
greater and greater. At 260,000 kilometers per second, its
length in the direction of movement was only half what it
was at rest, and its mass was twice what it was. As the speed
of light was approached, its length would approach zero in
the direction of motion, while its mass would approach the
infinite.</p>
<p>Could this really be so? Ordinary objects never moved so
fast as to make their lengths and masses show any measurable
change. What about subatomic particles, however, which
moved at tens of thousands of kilometers per second? The
German physicist Alfred Heinrich Bucherer (1863-1927)
reported in 1908 that speeding electrons did gain in mass just
the amount predicted by Einstein&rsquo;s theory. The increased
mass with energy has been confirmed with great precision in
recent years. Einstein&rsquo;s special theory of relativity has met
many experimental tests exactly ever since and it is generally
accepted by physicists today.</p>
<p>Einstein&rsquo;s theory gave rise to something else as well.
Einstein deduced that mass was a form of energy. He worked
out a relationship (the &ldquo;mass-energy equivalence&rdquo;) that is
expressed as follows:</p>
<p class="center"><i>E</i> = <i>mc</i>&sup2;</p>
<p>where <i>E</i> represents energy, <i>m</i> is mass, and <i>c</i> is the speed of
light.</p>
<p>If mass is measured in grams and the speed of light is
measured in centimeters per second, then the equation will
yield the energy in a unit called &ldquo;ergs&rdquo;. It turns out that 1
gram of mass is equal to 900,000,000,000,000,000,000 (900
billion billion) ergs of energy. The erg is a very small unit of
energy, but 900 billion billion of them mount up.</p>
<p>The energy equivalent of 1 gram of mass (and remember
that a gram, in ordinary units, is only &sup1;/&#8322;&#8328; of an ounce) would
keep a 100-watt light bulb burning for 35,000 years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<div class="img" id="pic_6">
<img src="images/pmg006.jpg" alt="ENERGY CREATED compared to MATTER (OR MASS) DESTROYED" width="500" height="414" />
</div>
<p>It is this vast difference between the tiny quantity of
mass and the huge amount of energy to which it is equivalent
that obscured the relationship over the years. When a
chemical reaction liberates energy, the mass of the materials
undergoing the reaction decreases slightly&mdash;but <i>very</i> slightly.</p>
<p>Suppose, for instance, a gallon of gasoline is burned. The
gallon of gasoline has a mass of 2800 grams and combines
with about 10,000 grams of oxygen to form carbon dioxide
and water, yielding 1.35 million billion ergs. That&rsquo;s a lot of
energy and it will drive an automobile for some 25 to 30
kilometers. But by Einstein&rsquo;s equation all that energy is
equivalent to only a little over a millionth of a gram. You
start with 12,800 grams of reacting materials and you end
with 12,800 grams minus a millionth of a gram or so that was
given off as energy.</p>
<p>No instrument known to the chemists of the 19th
century could have detected so tiny a loss of mass in such a
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
large total. No wonder, then, that from Lavoisier on,
scientists thought that the law of conservation of mass held
exactly.</p>
<p>Radioactive changes gave off much more energy per atom
than chemical changes did, and the percentage loss in mass
was correspondingly greater. The loss of mass in radioactive
changes was found to match the production of energy in just
the way Einstein predicted.</p>
<p>It was no longer quite accurate to talk about the
conservation of mass after 1905 (even though mass was just
about conserved in ordinary chemical reactions so that the
law could continue to be used by chemists without trouble).
Instead, it is more proper to speak of the conservation of
energy, and to remember that mass was one form of energy
and a very concentrated form.</p>
<p>The mass-energy equivalence fully explained why the
atom should contain so great a store of energy. Indeed, the
surprise was that radioactive changes gave off as little energy
as they did. When a uranium atom broke down through a
series of steps to a lead atom, it produced a million times as
much energy as that same atom would release if it were
involved in even the most violent of chemical changes.
Nevertheless, that enormous energy change in the radioactive
breakdown represented only about one-half of 1% of the
total energy to which the mass of the uranium atom was
equivalent.</p>
<p>Once Rutherford worked out the nuclear theory of the
atom, it became clear from the mass-energy equivalence that
the source of the energy of radioactivity was likely to be in
the atomic nucleus where almost all the mass of the atom was
to be found.</p>
<p>The attention of physicists therefore turned to the
nucleus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<h2 id="c17">THE STRUCTURE OF THE NUCLEUS</h2>
<h3 id="c18">The Proton</h3>
<p>As early as 1886 Eugen Goldstein, who was working with
cathode rays, also studied rays that moved in the opposite
direction. Since the cathode rays (electrons) were negatively
charged, rays moving in the opposite direction would have to
be positively charged. In 1907 J. J. Thomson called them
&ldquo;positive rays&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Once Rutherford worked out the nuclear structure of the
atom, it seemed clear that the positive rays were atomic
nuclei from which a number of electrons had been knocked
away. These nuclei came in different sizes.</p>
<p>Were the nuclei single particles&mdash;a different one for
every isotope of every element? Or were they all built up out
of numbers of still smaller particles of a very limited number
of varieties? Might it be that the nuclei owed their positive
electrical charge to the fact that they contained particles just
like the electron, but ones that carried a positive charge
rather than a negative one?</p>
<p>All attempts to discover this &ldquo;positive electron&rdquo; in the
nuclei failed, however. The smallest nucleus found was that
produced by knocking the single electron off a hydrogen
atom in one way or another. This hydrogen nucleus had a
single positive charge, one that was exactly equal in size to
the negative charge on the electron. The hydrogen nucleus,
however, was much more massive than an electron. The
hydrogen nucleus with its single positive charge was approximately
1837 times as massive as the electron with its single
negative charge.</p>
<p>Was it possible to knock the positive charge loose from
the mass of the hydrogen nucleus? Nothing physicists did
could manage to do that. In 1914 Rutherford decided the
attempt should be given up. He suggested that the hydrogen
nucleus, for all its high mass, should be considered the unit of
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
positive electrical charge, just as the electron was the unit of
negative electrical charge. He called the hydrogen nucleus a
&ldquo;proton&rdquo; from the Greek word for &ldquo;first&rdquo; because it was the
nucleus of the first element.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_7">
<img src="images/pmg007.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="321" />
<p class="caption small"><i>One proton balances 1837 electrons.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Why the proton should be so much more massive than
the electron is still one of the unanswered mysteries of
physics.</p>
<h3 id="c19">The Proton-Electron Theory</h3>
<p>What about the nuclei of elements other than hydrogen?</p>
<p>All the other elements had nuclei more massive than that
of hydrogen and the natural first guess was that these were
made up of some appropriate number of protons closely
packed together. The helium nucleus, which had a mass four
times as great as that of hydrogen, might be made up of 4
protons; the oxygen nucleus with a mass number of 16 might
be made up of 16 protons and so on.</p>
<p>This guess, however, ran into immediate difficulties. A
helium nucleus might have a mass number of 4 but it had an
electric charge of +2. If it were made up of 4 protons, it
ought to have an electric charge of +4. In the same way, an
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
oxygen nucleus made up of 16 protons ought to have a
charge of +16, but in actual fact it had one of +8.</p>
<p>Could it be that something was cancelling part of the
positive electric charge? The only thing that could do so
would be a negative electric charge<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
and these were to be
found only on electrons as far as anyone knew in 1914. It
seemed reasonable, then, to suppose that a nucleus would
contain about half as many electrons in addition to the
protons. The electrons were so light, they wouldn&rsquo;t affect the
mass much, and they would succeed in cancelling some of the
positive charge.</p>
<p>Thus, according to this early theory, <i>now known to be
incorrect</i>, the helium nucleus contained not only 4 protons,
but 2 electrons in addition. The helium nucleus would then
have a mass number of 4 and an electric charge (atomic
number) of 4 - 2, or 2. This was in accordance with
observation.</p>
<p>This &ldquo;proton-electron theory&rdquo; of nuclear structure accounted
for isotopes very nicely. While oxygen-16 had a
nucleus made up of 16 protons and 8 electrons, oxygen-17
had one of 17 protons and 9 electrons, and oxygen-18 had
one of 18 protons and 10 electrons. The mass numbers were
16, 17, and 18, respectively, but the atomic number was
16 - 8, 17 - 9, and 18 - 10, or 8 in each case.</p>
<p>Again, uranium-238 has a nucleus built up, according to
this theory, of 238 protons and 146 electrons, while
uranium-235 has one built up of 235 protons and 143
electrons. In these cases the atomic number is, respectively,
238 - 146 and 235 - 143, or 92 in each case. The nucleus of
the 2 isotopes is, however, of different structure and it is not
surprising therefore that the radioactive properties of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
two&mdash;properties that involve the nucleus&mdash;should be different
and that the half-life of uranium-238 should be six
times as long as that of uranium-235.</p>
<p>The presence of electrons in the nucleus not only
explained the existence of isotopes, but seemed justified by
two further considerations.</p>
<p>First, it is well known that similar charges repel each
other and that the repulsion is stronger the closer together
the similar charges are forced. Dozens of positively charged
particles squeezed into the tiny volume of an atomic nucleus
couldn&rsquo;t possibly remain together for more than a tiny
fraction of a second. Electrical repulsion would send them
flying apart at once.</p>
<p>On the other hand, opposite charges attract, and a proton
and an electron would attract each other as strongly as 2
protons (or 2 electrons) would repel each other. It was
thought possible that the presence of electrons in a collection
of protons might somehow limit the repulsive force and
stabilize the nucleus.</p>
<p>Second, there are radioactive decays in which beta
particles are sent flying out of the atom. From the energy
involved they could come only out of the nucleus. Since beta
particles are electrons and since they come from the nucleus,
it seemed to follow that there must be electrons within the
nucleus to begin with.</p>
<p>The proton-electron theory of nuclear structure also
seemed to account neatly for many of the facts of radioactivity.</p>
<p>Why radioactivity at all, for instance? The more complex
a nucleus is, the more protons must be squeezed together and
the harder, it would seem, it must be to keep them together.
<i>More and more electrons seemed to be required.</i> Finally,
when the total number of protons was 84 or more, no
amount of electrons seemed sufficient to stabilize the
nucleus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>The manner of breakup fits the theory, too. Suppose a
nucleus gives off an alpha particle. The alpha particle is a
helium nucleus made up, by this theory, of 4 protons and 2
electrons. If a nucleus loses an alpha particle, its mass number
should decline by 4 and its atomic number by 4 - 2, or 2.
And, indeed, when uranium-238 (atomic number 92) gives
off an alpha particle, it becomes thorium-234 (atomic
number 90).</p>
<p>Suppose a beta particle is emitted. A beta particle is an
electron and if a nucleus loses an electron, its mass number is
almost unchanged. (An electron is so light that in comparison
with the nucleus, we can ignore its mass.) On the other hand,
a unit negative charge is gone. One of the protons in the
nucleus, which had previously been masked by an electron, is
now unmasked. Its positive charge is added to the rest and
the atomic number goes up by one. Thus, thorium-234
(atomic number 90) gives up a beta particle and becomes
protactinium-234 (atomic number 91).</p>
<p>If a gamma ray is given off, that gamma ray has no charge
and the equivalent of very little mass. That means that
neither the mass number nor the atomic number of the
nucleus is changed, although its energy content is altered.</p>
<p>Even more elaborate changes can be taken into account.
In the long run, uranium-238, having gone through many
changes, becomes lead-206. Those changes include the
emission of 8 alpha particles and 6 beta particles. The 8 alpha
particles involve a loss of 8 &times; 4, or 32 in mass number, while
the 6 beta particles contribute nothing in this respect. And,
indeed, the mass number of uranium-238 declines by 32 in
reaching lead-206. On the other hand the 8 alpha particles
involve a decrease in atomic number of 8 &times; 2, or 16, while
the 6 beta particles involve an increase in atomic number of
6 &times; 1, or 6. The total change is a decrease of 16 - 6, or 10.
And indeed, uranium (atomic number 92) changes to lead
(atomic number 82).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>It is useful to go into such detail concerning the
proton-electron theory of nuclear structure and to describe
how attractive it seemed. The theory appeared solid and
unshakable and, indeed, physicists used it with considerable
satisfaction for 15 years.</p>
<p>&mdash;And yet, as we shall see, it was wrong; and that should
point a moral. Even the best seeming of theories may be
wrong in some details and require an overhaul.</p>
<h3 id="c20">Protons in Nuclei</h3>
<p>Let us, nevertheless, go on to describe some of the
progress made in the 1920s in terms of the proton-electron
theory that was then accepted.</p>
<p>Since a nucleus is made up of a whole number of protons,
its mass ought to be a whole number if the mass of a single
proton is considered 1. (The presence of electrons would add
some mass but in order to simplify matters, let us ignore
that.)</p>
<p>When isotopes were first discovered this indeed seemed to
be so. However, Aston and his mass spectrometer kept
measuring the mass of different nuclei more and more closely
during the 1920s and found that they differed very slightly
from whole numbers. Yet a fixed number of protons turned
out to have different masses if they were first considered
separately and then as part of a nucleus.</p>
<p>Using modern standards, the mass of a proton is
1.007825. Twelve separate protons would have a total mass
of twelve times that, or 12.0939. On the other hand, if the
12 protons are packed together into a carbon-12 nucleus, the
mass is 12 so that the mass of the individual protons is
1.000000 apiece. What happens to this difference of
0.007825 between the proton in isolation and the proton as
part of a carbon-12 nucleus?</p>
<p>According to Einstein&rsquo;s special theory of relativity, the
missing mass would have to appear in the form of energy. If
12 hydrogen nuclei (protons) plus 6 electrons are packed
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
together to form a carbon nucleus, a considerable quantity of
energy would have to be given off.</p>
<p>In general, Aston found that as one went on to more and
more complicated nuclei, a larger fraction of the mass would
have to appear as energy (though not in a perfectly regular
way) until it reached a maximum in the neighborhood of
iron.</p>
<p>Iron-56, the most common of the iron isotopes, has a
mass number of 55.9349. Each of its 56 protons, therefore,
has a mass of 0.9988.</p>
<p>For nuclei more complicated than those of iron, the
protons in the nucleus begin to grow more massive again.
Uranium-238 nuclei, for instance, have a mass of 238.0506,
so that each of the 238 protons they contain has a mass of
1.0002.</p>
<p>By 1927 Aston had made it clear that it is the middle
elements in the neighborhood of iron that are most closely
and economically packed. If a very massive nucleus is broken
up into somewhat lighter nuclei, the proton packing would
be tighter and some mass would be converted into energy.
Similarly, if very light nuclei were joined together into
somewhat more massive nuclei, some mass would be converted
into energy.</p>
<p>This demonstration that energy was released in any shift
away from either extreme of the list of atoms according to
atomic number fits the case of radioactivity, where very
massive nuclei break down to somewhat less massive ones.</p>
<p>Consider that uranium-238 gives up 8 alpha particles and
6 beta particles to become lead-206. The uranium-238
nucleus has a mass of 238.0506; each alpha particle has one
of 4.0026 for a total of 32.0208; each beta particle has a
mass of 0.00154 for a total of 0.00924; and the lead-206
nucleus has one of 205.9745.</p>
<p>This means that the uranium-238 nucleus (mass:
238.0506) changes into 8 alpha particles, 6 beta particles,
and a lead-206 nucleus (total mass: 238.0045). The starting
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
mass is 0.0461 greater than the final mass and it is this
missing mass that has been converted into energy and is
responsible for the gamma rays and for the velocity with
which alpha particles and beta particles are discharged.</p>
<h3 id="c21">Nuclear Bombardment</h3>
<p>Once scientists realized that there was energy which
became available when one kind of nucleus was changed into
another, an important question arose as to whether such a
change could be brought about and regulated by man and
whether this might not be made the source of useful power
of a kind and amount undreamed of earlier.</p>
<p>Chemical energy was easy to initiate and control, since
that involved the shifts of electrons on the outskirts of the
atoms. Raising the temperature of a system, for instance,
caused atoms to move more quickly and smash against each
other harder, and that in itself was sufficient to force
electrons to shift and to initiate a chemical reaction that
would not take place at lower temperatures.</p>
<p>To shift the protons within the nucleus (&ldquo;nuclear
reactions&rdquo;) and make nuclear energy available was a harder
problem by far. The particles involved were much more
massive than electrons and correspondingly harder to move.
What&rsquo;s more, they were buried deep within the atom. No
temperatures available to the physicists of the 1920s could
force atoms to smash together hard enough to reach and
shake the nucleus.</p>
<p>In fact, the only objects that were known to reach the
nucleus were speeding subatomic particles. As early as 1906,
for instance, Rutherford had used the speeding alpha
particles given off by a radioactive substance to bombard
matter and to show that sometimes these alpha particles were
deflected by atomic nuclei. It was, in fact, by such an
experiment that he first demonstrated the existence of such
nuclei.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Rutherford had continued his experiments with bombardment.
An alpha particle striking a nucleus would knock
it free of the atom to which it belonged and send it shooting
forward (like one billiard ball hitting another). The nucleus
that shot ahead would strike a film of chemical that
scintillated (sparkled) under the impact. In a rough way, one
could tell the kind of nucleus that struck from the nature of
the sparkling.</p>
<p>In 1919 Rutherford bombarded nitrogen gas with alpha
particles and found that he obtained the kind of sparkling he
associated with the bombardment of hydrogen gas. When he
bombarded hydrogen, the alpha particles struck hydrogen
nuclei (protons) and shot them forward. To get hydrogen-sparkling
out of the bombardment of nitrogen, Rutherford
felt, he must have knocked protons out of the nitrogen
nuclei. Indeed, as was later found, he had converted nitrogen
nuclei into oxygen nuclei.</p>
<p>This was the first time in history that the atomic nucleus
was altered by deliberate human act.</p>
<p>Rutherford continued his experiments and by 1924 had
shown that alpha particles could be used to knock protons
out of the nuclei of almost all elements up to potassium
(atomic number 19).</p>
<p>There were, however, limitations to the use of natural
alpha particles as the bombarding agent.</p>
<p>First, the alpha particles used in bombardment were
positively charged and so were the atomic nuclei. This meant
that the alpha particles and the atomic nuclei repelled each
other and much of the energy of the alpha particles was used
in overcoming the repulsion. For more and more massive
nuclei, the positive charge grew higher and the repulsion
stronger until for elements beyond potassium, no collision
could be forced, even with the most energetic naturally
occurring alpha particles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<div class="img" id="pic_8">
<img src="images/pmg008.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="361" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Man-made transmutation.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>Second, the alpha particles that are sprayed toward the
target cannot be aimed directly at the nuclei. An alpha
particle strikes a nucleus only if, by chance, they come
together. The nuclei that serve as their targets are so
unimaginably small that most of the bombarding particles are
sure to miss. In Rutherford&rsquo;s first bombardment of nitrogen,
it was calculated that only 1 alpha particle out of 300,000
managed to strike a nitrogen nucleus.</p>
<p>The result of these considerations is clear. There is energy
to be gained out of nuclear reactions, but there is also energy
that must be expended to cause these nuclear reactions. In
the case of nuclear bombardment by subatomic particles
(the only way, apparently, in which nuclear reactions can be
brought about), the energy expended seems to be many times
the energy to be extracted. This is because so many
subatomic particles use up their energy in ionizing atoms,
knocking electrons away, and never initiate nuclear reactions
at all.</p>
<p>It was as though the only way you could light a candle
would be to strike 300,000 matches, one after the other. If
that were so, candles would be impractical.</p>
<p>In fact, the most dramatic result of alpha particle
bombardment had nothing to do with energy production, but
rather the reverse. New nuclei were produced that had <i>more</i>
energy than the starting nuclei, so that energy was absorbed
by the nuclear reaction rather than given off.</p>
<p>This came about first in 1934, when a French husband-and-wife
team of physicists, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Joliot-Curie
(1900-1958) and Ir&egrave;ne Joliot-Curie (1897-1956) were bombarding
aluminum-27 (atomic number 13) with alpha particles.
The result was to combine part of the alpha particle
with the aluminum-27 nucleus to form a new nucleus with an
atomic number two units higher&mdash;15&mdash;and a mass number
three units higher&mdash;30.</p>
<p>The element with atomic number 15 is phosphorus so
that phosphorus-30 was formed. The only isotope of phosphorus
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
that occurs in nature, however, is phosphorus-31.
Phosphorus-30 was the first man-made nucleus&mdash;the first to
be manufactured by nuclear reactions in the laboratory.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_9">

<p class="caption small"><i>Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric and Ir&egrave;ne Joliot-Curie</i></p>

<p>The reason phosphorus-30 did not occur in nature was
that its energy content was too high to allow it to be stable.
Its energy content drained away through the emission of
particles that allowed the nucleus to change over into a stable
one, silicon-30 (atomic number 14). This was an example of
&ldquo;artificial radioactivity&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Since 1934, over a thousand kinds of nuclei that do not
occur in nature have been formed in the laboratory through
various kinds of bombardment-induced nuclear reactions.
Every single one of them proved to be radioactive.</p>
<h3 id="c22">Particle Accelerators</h3>
<p>Was there nothing that could be done to make nuclear
bombardment more efficient and increase the chance of
obtaining useful energy out of nuclear reactions?</p>
<p>In 1928 the Russian-American physicist George Gamow
(1904-1968) suggested that protons might be used as
bombarding agents in place of alpha particles. Protons were
only one-fourth as massive as alpha particles and the collision
might be correspondingly less effective; on the other hand,
protons had only half the positive charge of alpha particles
and would not be as strongly repelled by the nuclei. Then,
too, protons were much more easily available than alpha
particles. To get a supply of protons one only had to ionize
the very common hydrogen atoms, i.e., get rid of the single
electron of the hydrogen atom, and a single proton is left.</p>

<p>Of course, protons obtained by the ionization of hydrogen
atoms have very little energy, but could energy be
imparted to them? Protons carry a positive charge and a force
can therefore be exerted upon them by an electric or
magnetic field. In a device that makes use of such fields,
protons can be accelerated (made to go faster and faster),
and thus gain more and more energy. In the end, if enough
energy is gained, the proton could do more damage than the
alpha particle, despite the former&rsquo;s smaller mass. Combine
that with the smaller repulsion involved and the greater ease
of obtaining protons&mdash;and the weight of convenience and
usefulness would swing far in the direction of the proton.</p>
<p>Physicists began to try to design &ldquo;particle accelerators&rdquo;
and the first practical device of this sort was produced in
1929 by the two British physicists John Douglas Cockcroft
(1897-1967) and Ernest Thomas Sinton Walton (1903-<span class="hst"> )</span>.
Their device, called an &ldquo;electrostatic accelerator&rdquo;, produced
protons that were sufficiently energetic to initiate nuclear
reactions. In 1931 they used their accelerated protons to
disrupt the nucleus of lithium-7. It was the first nuclear
reaction to be brought about by man-made bombarding
particles.</p>
<p>Other types of particle accelerators were also being
developed at this time. The most famous was the one built in
1930 by the American physicist Ernest Orlando Lawrence
(1901-1958). In this device a magnet was used to make the
protons move in gradually expanding circles, gaining energy
with each lap until they finally moved out beyond the
influence of the magnet and then hurtled out of the
instrument in a straight line at maximum energy. This
instrument was called a &ldquo;cyclotron&rdquo;.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>The cyclotron was rapidly improved, using larger magnets
and increasingly sophisticated design. There are now, at this
time of writing, &ldquo;proton synchrotrons&rdquo; (descendants of that
first cyclotron) that produce particles with over a million
times the energy of those produced by Lawrence&rsquo;s first
cyclotron. Of course, the first cyclotron was only a quarter
of a meter wide, while the largest today has a diameter of
some 2000 meters.</p>
<p>As particle accelerators grew larger, more efficient, and
more powerful, they became ever more useful in studying the
structure of the nucleus and the nature of the subatomic
particles themselves. They did not serve, however, to bring
the dream of useful nuclear energy any closer. Though they
brought about the liberation of vastly more nuclear energy
than Rutherford&rsquo;s initial bombardments could, they also
consumed a great deal more energy in the process.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that Rutherford, the pioneer in
nuclear bombardment, was pessimistic. To the end of his
days (he died in 1937) he maintained that it would be forever
impossible to tap the energy of the nucleus for use by man.
Hopes that &ldquo;nuclear power&rdquo; might some day run the world&rsquo;s
industries were, in his view, an idle dream.</p>

<h2 id="c23">THE NEUTRON</h2>
<h3 id="c24">Nuclear Spin</h3>
<p>What Rutherford did not (and could not) take into
account were the consequences of a completely new type of
nuclear bombardment involving a type of particle unknown
in the 1920s (though Rutherford speculated about the
possibility of its existence).</p>
<p>The beginnings of the new path came about through the
reluctant realization that there was a flaw in the apparently
firmly grounded proton-electron picture of nuclear structure.</p>
<p>The flaw involved the &ldquo;nuclear spin&rdquo;. In 1924 the
Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli (1900-1958) worked out a
theory that treated protons and electrons as though they
were spinning on their axes. This spin could be in either
direction (or, as we would say in earthly terms, from
west-to-east, or from east-to-west). Quantum theory has
shown that a natural unit exists for what is called the angular
momentum of this spin. Measured in terms of this natural
unit of spin, the proton and the electron have spin &frac12;. If the
particle spun in one direction it was +&frac12;, if in the other it was
-&frac12;.</p>
<p>When subatomic particles came together to form an
atomic nucleus, each kept its original spin, and the nuclear
spin was then equal to the total angular momentum of the
individual particles that made it up.</p>
<p>For instance, suppose the helium nucleus is made up of 4
protons and 2 electrons, as was thought in the 1920s. Of the
4 protons, suppose that two had a spin of +&frac12; and two of
-&frac12;. Suppose also that of the 2 electrons, one had a spin of
+&frac12; and one of -&frac12;. All the spins would cancel each other.
The total angular momentum would be zero.</p>
<p>Of course, it is also possible that all 6 particles were
spinning in the same direction; all +&frac12; or all -&frac12;. In that case
the nuclear spin would be 3, either in one direction or the
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
other. If 5 particles were spinning in one direction and 1 in
the other, then the total spin would be 2, in one direction or
the other.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_14">
<img src="images/pmg014.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="498" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Wolfgang Pauli lecturing in Copenhagen in April 1929.</i></p>
</div>
<p>In short if you have an even number of particles in a
nucleus, each with a spin of +&frac12; or -&frac12;, then the total spin is
either zero or a whole number, no matter what combination
of positive and negative spins you choose. (The total spin is
always written as a positive number.)</p>
<p>On the other hand, suppose you have lithium-7, which
was thought to be made up of 7 protons and 4 electrons. If
the 7 protons were all +&frac12; and the 4 electrons were all -&frac12; in
their spins, the nuclear spin would be &#8311;/&#8322; - &#8308;/&#8322; = &sup3;/&#8322;.</p>
<p>If you have an odd number of particles in the nucleus,
you will find that any combination of positive and negative
spins will <i>never</i> give you either zero or a whole number as a
sum. The sum will always include a fraction.</p>
<p>Consequently, if one measures the spin of a particular
atomic nucleus one can tell at once whether that nucleus
contains an even number of particles or an odd number.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>This quickly raised a problem. The nuclear spin of the
common isotope, nitrogen-14, was measured accurately over
and over again and turned out to be 1. There seemed no
doubt about that and it could therefore be concluded that
there were an even number of particles in the nitrogen-14
nucleus.</p>
<p>And yet, by the proton-electron theory of nuclear
structure, the nitrogen-14 nucleus, with a mass number of 14
and an atomic number of 7, had to be made up of 14 protons
and 7 electrons for a total of 21 particles altogether&mdash;an odd
number.</p>
<p>The nuclear spin of nitrogen-14 indicated &ldquo;even number&rdquo;
and the proton-electron theory indicated &ldquo;odd number&rdquo;.
One or the other had to be wrong, but which? The nuclear
spin was a matter of actual measurement, which could be
repeated over and over and on which all agreed. The
proton-electron theory was only a theory. It was therefore
the latter that was questioned.</p>
<p>What was to be done?</p>
<p>Suppose it is wrong to count protons and electrons inside
the nucleus as separate particles. Was it possible that an
electron and a proton, forced into the close confinement of
the atomic nucleus might, by the force of mutual attraction,
become so intimately connected as to count as a single
particle. One of the first to suggest this, as far back as 1920,
was Rutherford.</p>
<p>Such a proton-electron combination would be electrically
neutral and in 1921 the American chemist William
Draper Harkins (1873-1951) used the term &ldquo;neutron&rdquo; as a
name for it.</p>
<p>If we look at the nitrogen-14 nucleus in this way then it
is made up, not of 14 protons and 7 electrons, but of 7
protons and 7 proton-electron combinations. Instead of a
total of 21 particles, there would be a total of 14; instead of
an odd number, there would be an even number. The
structure would now account for the nuclear spin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>But could such a revised theory of nuclear structure be
made to seem plausible? The proton-electron theory seemed
to make sense because both protons and electrons were
known to exist separately and could be detected. If an
intimate proton-electron combination could also exist,
ought it not exist (or be made to exist) outside the nucleus
and ought it not be detected as an isolated particle?</p>
<h3 id="c25">Discovery of the Neutron</h3>
<p>Throughout the 1920s scientists searched for the neutron
but without success.</p>
<p>One of the troubles was that the particle was electrically
neutral. Subatomic particles could be detected in a variety of
ways, but every single way (right down to the present time)
makes use of their electric charge. The electric charge of a
speeding subatomic particle either repels electrons or attracts
them. In either case, electrons are knocked off atoms that are
encountered by the speeding subatomic particle.</p>
<p>The atoms with electrons knocked off are now positively
charged ions. Droplets of water vapor can form about these
ions, or a bubble of gas can form, or a spark of light can be
seen. The droplets, the bubbles, and the light can all be
detected one way or another and the path of the subatomic
particle could be followed by the trail of ions it left behind.
Gamma rays, though they carry no charge, are a wave form
capable of ionizing atoms.</p>
<p>All the particles and rays that can leave a detectable track
of ions behind are called &ldquo;ionizing radiation&rdquo; and these are
easy to detect.</p>
<p>The hypothetical proton-electron combination, however,
which was neither a wave form nor a charged particle
was not expected to be able to ionize atoms. It would wander
among the atoms without either attracting or repelling
electrons and would therefore leave the atomic structure
intact. Its pathway could not be followed. In short, then, the
neutron was, so to speak, invisible, and the search for it
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
seemed a lost cause. And until it was found, the proton-electron
theory of nuclear structure, whatever its obvious
deficiencies with respect to nuclear spin, remained the only
one to work with.</p>
<p>Then came 1930. The German physicist Walther Wilhelm
Georg Bothe (1891-1957) and a co-worker, H. Becker, were
bombarding the light metal, beryllium, with alpha particles.
Ordinarily, they might expect protons to be knocked out of
it, but in this case no protons appeared. They detected some
sort of radiation because something was creating certain
effects while the alpha particles were bombarding the
beryllium but not after the bombardment ceased.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_15">
<img src="images/pmg015.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="743" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Walther W. G. Bothe</i></p>
</div>
<p>To try to determine something about the properties of
this radiation, Bothe and Becker tried putting objects in the
way of the radiation. They found the radiation to be
remarkably penetrating. It even passed through several
centimeters of lead. The only form of radiation that was
known at that time to come out of bombarded matter with
the capacity of penetrating a thick layer of lead was gamma
rays. Bothe and Becker, therefore, decided they had produced
gamma rays and reported this.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>In 1932 the Joliot-Curies repeated the Bothe-Becker
work and got the same results. However, among the objects
they placed in the path of the new radiation, they included
paraffin, which is made up of the light atoms of carbon and
hydrogen. To their surprise, protons were knocked out of the
paraffin.</p>
<p>Gamma rays had never been observed to do this, but the
Joliot-Curies could not think what else the radiation might
be. They simply reported that they had discovered gamma
rays to be capable of a new kind of action.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_16">
<img src="images/pmg016.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="710" />
<p class="caption small"><i>James Chadwick</i></p>
</div>
<p>Not so the English physicist James Chadwick
(1891-<span class="hst"> )</span>. In that same year he maintained that a gamma
ray, which possessed no mass, simply lacked the momentum
to hurl a proton out of its place in the atom. Even an
electron was too light to do so. (It would be like trying to
knock a baseball off the ground and into the air by hitting it
with a ping-pong ball.)</p>
<p>Any radiation capable of knocking a proton out of an
atom had to consist of particles that were themselves pretty
massive. And if one argued like that, then it seemed that the
radiation first observed by Bothe and Becker had to be the
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
long-sought-for proton-electron combination. Chadwick
used Harkins&rsquo; term, neutron, for it and made it official. He
gets the credit for the discovery of the neutron.</p>
<p>Chadwick managed to work out the mass of the neutron
from his experiments and by 1934 it was quite clear that the
neutron was more massive than the proton. The best modern
data have the mass of the proton set at 1.007825, and that of
the neutron just a trifle greater at 1.008665.</p>
<p>The fact that the neutron was just about as massive as the
proton was to be expected if the neutron were a proton-electron
combination. It was also not surprising that the
isolated neutron eventually breaks up, giving up an electron
and becoming a proton. Out of any large number of
neutrons, half have turned into protons in about 12 minutes.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, although in some ways we can explain the
neutron by speaking of it as though it were a proton-electron
combination, it really is not. A neutron has a spin of
&frac12; while a proton-electron combination would have a spin of
either 0 or 1. The neutron, therefore, must be treated as a
single uncharged particle.</p>
<h3 id="c26">The Proton-Neutron Theory</h3>
<p>As soon as the neutron was discovered, the German
physicist Werner Karl Heisenberg (1901-<span class="hst"> )</span> revived the
notion that the nucleus must be made up of protons and
neutrons, rather than protons and electrons. It was very easy
to switch from the latter theory to the former, if one simply
remembered to pair the electrons thought to be in the
nucleus with protons and give the name neutrons to these
combinations.</p>
<p>Thus, the helium-4 nucleus, rather than being made up of
4 protons and 2 electrons, was made up of 2 protons and 2
proton-electron combinations; or 2 protons and 2 neutrons.
In the same way the oxygen-16 nucleus instead of being
made up of 16 protons and 8 electrons, would be made up of
8 protons and 8 neutrons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>The proton-neutron theory would account for mass
numbers and atomic numbers perfectly well. If a nucleus was
made up of <i>x</i> protons and <i>y</i> neutrons, then the atomic
number was equal to <i>x</i> and the mass number to <i>x</i> + <i>y</i>. (It is
now possible to define the mass number of a nucleus in
modern terms. It is the number of protons plus neutrons in
the nucleus.)</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_17">
<img src="images/pmg017.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="576" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Werner Heisenberg</i></p>
</div>
<p>The proton-neutron theory of nuclear structure could
account for isotopes perfectly well, too. Consider the 3
oxygen isotopes, oxygen-16, oxygen-17, and oxygen-18. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
first would have a nucleus made up of 8 protons and 8
neutrons; the second, one of 8 protons and 9 neutrons; and
the third, one of 8 protons and 10 neutrons. In each case the
atomic number is 8. The mass numbers however would be 16,
17, and 18, respectively.</p>
<p>In the same way uranium-238 would have a nucleus built
of 92 protons and 146 neutrons, while uranium-235 would
have one of 92 protons and 143 neutrons.</p>
<p>By the new theory, can we suppose that it is neutrons
rather than electrons that somehow hold the protons
together against their mutual repulsion, and that more and
more neutrons are required to do this as the nucleus grows
more massive? At first the number of neutrons required is
roughly equal to the number of protons. The helium-4
nucleus contains 2 protons and 2 neutrons, the carbon-12
nucleus contains 6 protons and 6 neutrons, the oxygen-16
nucleus contains 8 protons and 8 neutrons, and so on.</p>
<p>For more complicated nuclei, additional neutrons are
needed. In vanadium-51, the nucleus contains 23 protons and
28 neutrons, five more than an equal amount. In bismuth-209,
it is 83 protons and 126 neutrons, 43 more than an
equal amount. For still more massive nuclei containing a
larger number of protons, no amount of neutrons is sufficient
to keep the assembly stable. The more massive nuclei are all
radioactive.</p>
<p>The manner of radioactive breakdown fits the theory,
too. Suppose a nucleus gives off an alpha particle. The alpha
particle is a helium nucleus made up of 2 protons and 2
neutrons. If a nucleus loses an alpha particle, its mass number
should decline by 4 and its atomic number by 2, and that is
what happens.</p>
<p>Suppose a nucleus gives off a beta particle. For a
moment, that might seem puzzling. If the nucleus contains
only protons and neutrons and no electrons, where does the
beta particle come from? Suppose we consider the neutrons
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
as proton-electron combinations. Within many nuclei, the
neutrons are quite stable and do not break up as they do in
isolation. In the case of certain nuclei, however, they do
break up.</p>
<p>Thus the thorium-234 nucleus is made up of 90 protons
and 144 neutrons. One of these neutrons might be viewed as
breaking up to liberate an electron and leaving behind an
unbound proton. If a beta particle leaves then, the number of
neutrons decreases by one and the number of protons
increases by one. The thorium-234 nucleus (90 protons, 144
neutrons) becomes a protactinium-234 nucleus (91 protons,
143 neutrons).</p>
<p>In short, the proton-neutron theory of nuclear structure
could explain all the observed facts just as well as the
proton-electron theory, and could explain the nuclear spins,
which the proton-electron theory could not. What&rsquo;s more,
the isolated neutron had been discovered.</p>
<p>The proton-neutron theory was therefore accepted and
remains accepted to this day.</p>
<h3 id="c27">The Nuclear Interaction</h3>
<p>In one place, and only one, did the proton-neutron
theory seem a little weaker than the proton-electron theory.
The electrons in the nucleus were thought to act as a kind of
glue holding together the protons.</p>
<p>But the electrons were gone. There were no negative
charges at all inside the nucleus, only the positive charges of
the proton, plus the uncharged neutron. As many as 83
positive charges were to be found (in the bismuth-209
nucleus) squeezed together and yet not breaking apart.</p>
<p>In the absence of electrons, what kept the protons
clinging together?</p>
<p>Was it possible that the electrical repulsion between 2
protons is replaced by an attraction if those protons were
pushed together closely enough? Can there be both an
attraction <i>and</i> a repulsion, with the former the more
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
important at very short range? If this were so, that
hypothetical attraction would have to have two properties.
First, it would have to be extremely strong&mdash;strong enough
to overcome the repulsion of two positive charges at very
close quarters. Secondly, it would have to be short-range, for
no attractive force between protons of any kind was ever
detected outside the nucleus.</p>
<p>In addition, this short-range attraction would have to
involve the neutron. The hydrogen-1 nucleus was made up of
a single proton, but all nuclei containing more than 1 proton
had to contain neutrons also to be stable, and only certain
numbers of neutrons.</p>
<p>Until the discovery of the neutron, only two kinds of
forces, or &ldquo;interactions&rdquo;, were known in the universe. These
were the &ldquo;gravitational interaction&rdquo; and the &ldquo;electromagnetic
interaction&rdquo;. The electromagnetic interaction was much the
stronger of the two&mdash;trillions and trillions and trillions of
times as strong as the gravitational attraction.</p>
<p>The electromagnetic attraction, however, includes both
attraction (between opposite electric charges or between
opposite magnetic poles) and repulsion (between like electric
charges or magnetic poles). In ordinary bodies, the attractions
and repulsions usually cancel each other entirely or
nearly entirely, leaving very little of one or the other to be
detected as surplus. The gravitational interaction, however,
includes only attraction and this increases with mass. By the
time you have gigantic masses such as the earth or the sun,
the gravitational interaction between them and other bodies
is also gigantic.</p>
<p>Both the gravitational and electromagnetic interactions
are long-range. The intensity of each interaction declines with
distance but only as the square of the distance. If the
distance between earth and sun were doubled, the gravitational
interaction would still be one-fourth what it is now. If
the distance were increased ten times, the interaction would
still be 1/(10 &times; 10) or 1/100 what it is now. It is for this
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
reason that gravitational and electromagnetic interactions can
make themselves felt over millions of miles of space.</p>
<p>But now, with the acceptance of the proton-neutron
theory of nuclear structure, physicists began to suspect the
existence of a third interaction&mdash;a &ldquo;nuclear interaction&rdquo;&mdash;much
stronger than the electromagnetic interaction, perhaps
130 times as strong. Furthermore, the nuclear interaction had
to decline very rapidly with distance much more rapidly than
the electromagnetic interaction did.</p>
<p>In that case, protons in virtual contact, as within the
nucleus, would attract each other, but if the distance
between them was increased sufficiently to place one outside
the nucleus, the nuclear interaction would decrease in
intensity to less than the electromagnetic repulsion. The
proton would now be repelled by the positive charge of the
nucleus and would go flying away. That is why atomic nuclei
have to be so small; it is only when they are so tiny that the
nuclear interaction can hold them together.</p>
<p>In 1932 Heisenberg tried to work out how these
interactions might come into being. He suggested that
attractions and repulsions were the result of particles being
constantly and rapidly exchanged by the bodies experiencing
the attractions and repulsions. Under some conditions, these
&ldquo;exchange particles&rdquo; moving back and forth very rapidly
between 2 bodies might force those bodies apart; under other
conditions they might pull those bodies together.</p>
<p>In the case of the electromagnetic interaction, the
exchange particles seemed to be &ldquo;photons&rdquo;, wave packets
that made up gamma rays, X rays, or even ordinary light (all
of which are examples of &ldquo;electromagnetic radiation&rdquo;). The
gravitational interaction would be the result of exchange
particles called &ldquo;gravitons&rdquo;. (In 1969, there were reports that
gravitons had actually been detected.)</p>
<p>Both the photon and the graviton have zero mass and
there is a connection between that and the fact that
electromagnetic interaction and gravitational interaction decline
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
only slowly with distance. For a nuclear interaction,
which declines very rapidly with distance, the exchange
particle (if any) would have to have mass.</p>
<p>In 1935 the Japanese physicist Hideki Yukawa
(1907-<span class="hst"> )</span> worked out in considerable detail the theory of
such exchange particles in order to decide what kind of
properties the one involved in the nuclear interaction would
have. He decided it ought to have a mass about 250 times
that of an electron, which would make it about &sup1;/&#8327; as massive
as a proton. Since this mass is intermediate between that of
an electron and proton, such particles eventually came to be
called &ldquo;mesons&rdquo; from a Greek word meaning &ldquo;intermediate&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Once Yukawa published his theory, the search was on for
the hypothetical mesons. Ideally, if they existed within the
nucleus, shooting back and forth between protons and
neutrons, there ought to be some way of knocking them out
of the nucleus and studying them in isolation. Unfortunately,
the bombarding particles at the disposal of physicists in the
1930s possessed far too little energy to knock mesons out of
nuclei, assuming they were there in the first place.</p>
<p>There was one way out. In 1911 the Austrian physicist
Victor Francis Hess (1883-1964) had discovered that earth
was bombarded from every side by &ldquo;cosmic rays&rdquo;. These
consisted of speeding atomic nuclei (&ldquo;cosmic particles&rdquo;) of
enormous energies&mdash;in some cases, billions of times as
intense as any energies available through particles produced
by mankind. If a cosmic particle of sufficient energy struck
an atomic nucleus in the atmosphere, it might knock mesons
out of it.</p>
<p>In 1936 the American physicists Carl David Anderson
(1905-<span class="hst"> )</span> and Seth Henry Neddermeyer (1907-<span class="hst"> )</span>,
studying the results of cosmic-particle bombardment of
matter, detected the existence of particles of intermediate
mass. This particle turned out to be lighter than Yukawa had
predicted; it was only about 207 times as massive as an
electron. Much worse, it lacked other properties that Yukawa
had predicted. It did not interact with the nucleus in the
manner expected.</p>

<p>In 1947, however, the English physicist Cecil Frank
Powell (1903-1969) and his co-workers, also studying
cosmic-particle bombardment, located another intermediate-sized
body, which had the right mass and all the other
appropriate properties to fit Yukawa&rsquo;s theories.</p>
<p>Anderson&rsquo;s particle was called a &ldquo;mu-meson&rdquo;, soon
abbreviated to &ldquo;muon&rdquo;. Powell&rsquo;s particle was called a
&ldquo;pi-meson&rdquo;, soon abbreviated to &ldquo;pion&rdquo;. With the discovery
of the pion, Yukawa&rsquo;s theory was nailed down and any
lingering doubt as to the validity of the proton-neutron
theory vanished.</p>

<p>(Actually, it turns out that there are two forces. The one
with the pion as exchange particle is the &ldquo;strong nuclear
interaction&rdquo;. Another, involved in beta particle emission, for
instance, is a &ldquo;weak interaction&rdquo;, much weaker than the
electromagnetic but stronger than the gravitational.)</p>
<p>The working out of the details of the strong nuclear
interaction explains further the vast energies to be found
resulting from nuclear reactions. Ordinary chemical reactions,
with the electron shifts that accompany them, involve the
electromagnetic interaction only. Nuclear energy, with the
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
shifts of the particles inside the nucleus, involves the much
stronger nuclear interaction.</p>
<h3 id="c28">Neutron Bombardment</h3>
<p>As soon as neutrons were discovered, it seemed to
physicists that they had another possible bombarding particle
of extraordinary properties. Since the neutron lacked any
electric charge, it could not be repelled by either electrons on
the outside of the atoms or by the nuclei at the center. The
neutron was completely indifferent to the electromagnetic
attraction and it just moved along in a straight line. If it
happened to be headed toward a nucleus it would strike it no
matter how heavy a charge that nucleus might have and very
often it would, as a result, induce a nuclear reaction where a
proton would not have been able to.</p>

</div>
<p>To be sure, it seemed just at first that there was a
disadvantage to the neutron&rsquo;s lack of charge. It could not be
accelerated directly by any device since that always depended
on electromagnetic interaction to which the neutron was
impervious.</p>
<p>There was one way of getting around this and this was
explained in 1935 by the American physicist J. Robert
Oppenheimer (1904-1967) and by his student Melba Phillips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>Use is made here of the nucleus of the hydrogen-2
(deuterium) nucleus. That nucleus, often called a &ldquo;deuteron&rdquo;,
is made up of 1 proton plus 1 neutron and has a mass
number of 2 and an atomic number of 1. Since it has a unit
positive charge, it can be accelerated just as an isolated
proton can be.</p>
<p>Suppose, then, that a deuteron is accelerated to a high
energy and is aimed right at a positively charged nucleus.
That nucleus repels the deuteron, and it particularly repels
the proton part. The nuclear interaction that holds together a
single proton and a single neutron is comparatively weak as
nuclear interactions go, and the repulsion of the nucleus that
the deuteron is approaching may force the proton out of the
deuteron altogether. The proton veers off, but the neutron,
unaffected, keeps right on going and, with all the energy it
had gained as part of the deuteron acceleration, smashes into
the nucleus.</p>
<p>Within a few months of their discovery, energetic
neutrons were being used to bring about nuclear reactions.</p>
<p>Actually, though, physicists didn&rsquo;t have to worry about
making neutrons energetic. This was a hangover from their
work with positively charged particles such as protons and
alpha particles. These charged particles had to be energetic to
overcome the repulsion of the nucleus and to smash into it
with enough force to break it up.</p>
<p>Neutrons, however, didn&rsquo;t have to overcome any repulsion.
No matter how little energy they had, if they were
correctly aimed (and some always were, through sheer
chance) they would approach and strike the nucleus.</p>
<p>In fact, the more slowly they travelled, the longer they
would stay in the vicinity of a nucleus and the more likely
they were to be captured by some nearby nucleus through
the attraction of the nuclear interaction. The influence of the
nucleus in capturing the neutron was greater the slower the
neutron, so that it was almost as though the nucleus were
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
larger and easier to hit for a slow neutron than a fast one.
Eventually, physicists began to speak of &ldquo;nuclear cross
sections&rdquo; and to say that particular nuclei had a cross section
of such and such a size for this bombarding particle or that.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of slow neutrons was discovered in
1934 by the Italian-American physicist Enrico Fermi
(1901-1954).</p>
<p>Of course, there was the difficulty that neutrons couldn&rsquo;t
be slowed down once they were formed, and as formed they
generally had too much energy (according to the new way of
looking at things). At least they couldn&rsquo;t be slowed down by
electromagnetic methods&mdash;but there were other ways.</p>
<p>A neutron didn&rsquo;t always enter a nucleus that it encountered.
Sometimes, if it struck the nucleus a hard,
glancing blow, it bounced off. If the nucleus struck by the
neutron is many times as massive as the neutron, the neutron
bounced off with all its speed practically intact. On the other
hand, if the neutron hits a nucleus not very much more
massive than itself, the nucleus rebounds and absorbs some of
the energy, so that the neutron bounces away with less
energy than it had. If the neutron rebounds from a number
of comparatively light nuclei, it eventually loses virtually all
its energy and finally moves about quite slowly, possessing no
more energy than the atoms that surround it.</p>
<p>(You can encounter this situation in ordinary life in the
case of billiard balls. A billiard ball, colliding with a cannon
ball, will just bounce, moving just as rapidly afterward as
before, though in a different direction. If a billiard ball
strikes another billiard ball, it will set the target ball moving
and bounce off itself with less speed.)</p>
<p>The energy of the molecules in the atmosphere depends
on temperature. Neutrons that match that energy and have
the ordinary quantity to be expected at room temperature
are called &ldquo;thermal&rdquo; (from a Greek word meaning &ldquo;heat&rdquo;)
neutrons. The comparatively light nuclei against which the
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
neutrons bounce and slow down are &ldquo;moderators&rdquo; because
they moderate the neutron&rsquo;s energy.</p>
<p>Fermi and his co-workers were the first to moderate
neutrons, produce thermal neutrons, and use them, in 1935,
to bombard nuclei. He quickly noted how large nuclear cross
sections became when thermal neutrons were the bombarding
particles.</p>
<p>It might seem that hope could now rise in connection
with the practical use of energy derived from nuclear
reactions. Neutrons could bring about nuclear reactions, even
when they themselves possessed very little energy, so output
might conceivably be more than input for each neutron that
struck. Furthermore because of the large cross sections
involved, thermal neutrons missed far less frequently than
high-energy charged particles did.</p>
<p>But there was a catch. Before neutrons could be used,
however low-energy and however sure to hit, they had to be
produced; and in order to produce neutrons they had to be
knocked out of nuclei by bombardment with high-energy
protons or some other such method. The energy formed by
the neutrons was at first never more than the tiniest fraction
of the energies that went into forming the neutrons in the
first place.</p>
<p>It was as though you could indeed light a candle with a
single match, but you still had to look through 300,000
useless pieces of wood before you found a match. The candle
would still be impractical.</p>
<p>Even with the existence of neutron bombardment,
involving low energy and high cross section, Rutherford
could, with justice, feel right down to the time of his death
that nuclear energy would never be made available for
practical use.</p>
<p>And yet, among the experiments that Fermi was trying in
1934 was that of sending his neutrons crashing into uranium
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
atoms. Rutherford had no way of telling (and neither had
Fermi) that this, finally, was the route to the unimaginable.</p>
<h2 id="c29">FOOTNOTES</h2>
<div class="fnblock"><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_1" href="#fr_1">[1]</a>The attempt to work out the structure of the nucleus resulted in a <i>false</i>, but
useful, theory that persisted throughout the 1920s. The great advances in nuclear
science in this decade were made in the light of this false theory and, for the sake
of historical accuracy, they are so presented here. The theory now believed
correct will be presented shortly, and you will see how matters can be changed
from the earlier concept to the later one.
